# Health-Services-Integration

This repository contains the archives created for the project of the subject of Health Services Integration and Architectures of the master 
in Telecommunications Engineering. The project consists of designing an architecture for the integration of different health services.
In our case we have designed a service for the detection of asbestosis from X-rays. We have used different standards such as DICOM, HL7 or X73 
among others, describing how they interconnect in a case study of the Andalusian Health System (Andalusia, Spain). This work is theoretical, since it has 
not been implemented in code, however it is interesting from the theoretical point of view. <br /> <br />
